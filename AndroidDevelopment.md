## Create working environment ##
### Eclipse IDE ###
It is recommended to use preconfigured ADT bundle. You can find more information [here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/bundle.html)

### Device connection ###
On Linux it just works, On Windows you need USB driver for your device. You can get it from manufacturer unless you have a Nexus device - than you can dowload the driver via Android SDK (included in the ADT bundle).

You can also configure a virtual device. Be warned that it is pretty slow, especially when starting.
